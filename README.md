# Computer-Systems
The course is about computer systems from the programmer’s perspective. We’ll be making a fairly deep dive into topics such as data representation, memory, assembly language, CPU architecture, networks, and concurrency. By the end of the course you’ll know a lot about how modern computers really work and how to take advantage of their advanced features.

1) By the end of the course you will

Understand machine data types and arithmetic

Be able to understand and write assembly language programs

Understand machine-level memory organization,  some types of machine-level security vulnerabilities and how to avoid introducing them, \ memory hierarchies, architectural features of modern processors, and how to optimize code for efficient execution, how linkers enable the creation of executables from separately-compiled modules, dynamic linking and run-time loading of shared objects, process address space layout, virtual memory translation hardware and how it is used for memory isolation and sharing, basic principles of computer networking

Use networking APIs such as sockets to implement network applications and concurrency using abstractions such as threads


2) Graduates of the program will have an ability to:

Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the programs discipline.
